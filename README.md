# C++ programming class
# mult.cpp: Multiplication Table Generator. The objective of this program is to read in two integers from standard input, and to output a multiplication table based on that input. The first number read will be the number of rows in the table. The second number will be the number of columns. Assume that all input will be correct (i.e., don't worry about error messages).
# factorial.cpp: Input one integer, and it will output the factorial of the integer. Learn the recursion in C++.
